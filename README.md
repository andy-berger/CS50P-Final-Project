## Description

**Cabinet Builder** helps you to create a plan for building a cabinet yourself.

Inputs:
* Kind of cabinet you want to build (cabinet with shelves or with drawers)
* Whether you want to build the cabinet with a left or right hand door (if you want to build a cabinet with shelves)
* The dimensions you want your cabinet to have (width/depth/height)
* The amount of shelves you want the cabinet to have (if you want to build a cabinet with shelves)
* Or the amount of drawers you want the cabinet to have (if you want to build a cabinet with drawers)

Furthermore you can edit the constants such as MIN_CUTTING_WIDTH, MAX_CUTTING_WIDTH and THICK_WOOD_THICKNESS in project.py depending on the min/max cutting limits and wood thickness.

Output:

You will get a PDF file with:
* a sketch of your cabinet including the dimensions
* the configuration of your cabinet (cabinet type and number of shelves or drawers)
* an illustration of all pieces you'll need to build the cabinet including the dimensions for each piece
